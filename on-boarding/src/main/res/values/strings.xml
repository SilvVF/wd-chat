        This app needs access to your devices location as well as the ability to discover nearby devices.
        The location permissions will not be used for any tracking purposes and are required by the WiFi Direct
        apis to locate other devices. The app will also need to access the network state to monitor the connection
        between other devices. Click the below button to accept the permissions from the popup. If the button does not work
        they may need to be changed in the settings.
